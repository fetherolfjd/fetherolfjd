# This Isn't Where I Parked My Car

And it isn't where you parked yours, either. Regardless: thanks for stopping by!

## Apropos

### Building

 - A personal interface to Tilt hydrometers: https://github.com/fetherolfjd/leaning-hydro-pi
 - Things which cannot yet be spoken of....

### Tinkering

 - Home automation can be a tricky beast: https://github.com/fetherolfjd/smart-garage-painful-diy
 - Windows Gaming VM on Linux host via GPU passthrough
 - A server running [ansible-nas](https://github.com/davestephens/ansible-nas) which I'm slowly trying to get away from because this just has too much

### Playing

 - Did you know there is a new edition of Warhammer 40k coming? https://warhammer40000.com/
   - I don't play actual games of this nearly enough, but I find the universe and story to be so rich and fun!
   - Also: [BOLTGUN](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005010/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun/)!!!
 - Mountain Biking: the activity I most enjoy to try and stay fit
